## 🔧 Troubleshooting Tips

- **App won’t install:** Check that your phone has enough free space and allows app installation from the source you used.  
- **Backend server not running:** Restart your computer and try running the backend installer again.

- **Camera not detecting face:** Make sure your face is well-lit and fully visible to the front camera.

## 📖 How It Works

Drowsy uses artificial intelligence technology that analyzes video input from your phone's camera. The backend server receives this data and runs machine learning models that detect eye closure, blinking speed, and other signs of drowsiness. When the system identifies risky signs, it sends an alert to your phone, helping you stay safe on long drives.

---

## 🛠️ Advanced Setup (Optional)

If you want more control or need to troubleshoot, you can access the backend system's control panel:

- Open a web browser on your computer.  
- Go to `http://localhost:8000` while the backend server runs.  
- Here, you can see logs of detections and adjust settings such as alert sensitivity.

You don’t need to do this to use Drowsy, but it may help in specific cases.
